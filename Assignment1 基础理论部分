0. Can you come up out 3 sceneraies which use AI methods?
Ans: {Machine Translation, Speech Recognizer, Face Recognition}

1. How do we use Github; Why do we use Jupyter and Pycharm;
Ans: {We use Github, because we want to share the codes with other people, we use Jupyter and Pycharm because it is the Python IDE }

2. What's the Probability Model?
Ans: We caculte the probobility of something occures. 

3. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Probability Model?
Ans: If we want to predict somothing, we often uese probability models, for example ecomonic growth

4. Why do we use probability and what's the difficult points for programming based on parsing and pattern match?
Ans:Because we coult not say or predict the exact number. Some patterns donot occure in your data for computing the probability. 

5. What's the Language Model;
Ans:We calculate the probobility of the words and the coocurrences of the words, and use it to represent the language. 

6. Can you came up with some sceneraies at which we could use Language Model?
Ans: We can use it to judge the sentences that the computer builds. 

7. What's the 1-gram language model;
Ans: We just calculate the propobilitiy of the single words and ignore their contexts. 

8. What's the disadvantages and advantages of 1-gram language model;
Ans: It is easy to comput, but it is not precise. 

9. What't the 2-gram models;
Ans: We caculate the probability of the coocurrence of two words.
